# GitHub Novel

## Work in Progress
This is a work in progress novel using git for version control and with an eye toward robust community contributions.

## How You Can Contribute
If you find grammatical or typographical errors, please feel free to submit a pull request to correct it. Editorial changes or even full-on story contributions are very welcome, with the caveates that 1. I may not integrate your contribution, 2. I may take part of your contribution but not all of it, 3. I own your contribution (at least for now â€“ see below).

## License
For now, this is under normal copywrite protections. I'm hoping to expand to a more permissive Creative Commons license in the future, but until then I will sue your ass.
