"I wouldn't have done it."
"Obviously."
"But she insisted."
"So what did you tell her?"
Arvin had his head down, listening to the strangers, despising them. It was easy for him to despise any strangers who happened to be talking, and to fall deeply, immediately in love with strangers who weren't talking.
"â€” like a cult leader."
The other one laughs. Too much. They are talking like they are on TV. People talk like they are on TV now, Arvin thought.
"She did! Like a cult leader."
In moments like this Arvin could see why terrorists blew up train stations. *They have a point*, he thought to himself.
Then they were both quiet and looking at him. Had he said that out loud? Yes, thinking about it a little bit more, accessing his sensory memory, that memory that could still hear himself like you can still taste an egg after eating an egg.
"Sorry, I meant to say that in my head," he said to them.
This did not put the women at ease. The one on his left, the alpha, the one who told some other woman (not pictured) that she looked like a cult leader, she looked at Arvin, the alpha did, with so much... nauseous displeasure... that it made Arvin look away and down again, into his fingernails. One could always look at one's own fingernails. Arvin was not a biter, thank god, or not a compulsive biter. He bit to groom and not a bite more. Sometimes he let them grow too long, even. Too long for Paula.
Everything Arvin did was too something for Paula, or else not enough something for her. Too long fingernails, not enough ambition. Too messy bedside table, not enough having friends. Too many dishes piling in the sink even though you're basically home all day, Arvin, not enough caring about anything he did.
That last part wasn't true. He cared about everything he did. So much that he didn't do anything. Or didn't do much. Or did so much it amounted to not doing anything. Jack of all trades. Those who can't teach. All the world's a stage and other cruel aphorisms.
But on all other counts Paula was right. Right not just in the sense of being correct, but right like on the right side of history. And that made it even more painful. Because he had no one to blame but himself. Take responsibility for yourself, a vague, blank-faced voice admonished him from within his own head. *What do I do but take responsibility?*, he asked the voice, and then panicked. Did I say that out loud again! He searched his sensory memory. No, no he had not said it out loud and anyway there they were talking like TV characters again. Taped live in front of an etc. 
"Mr. Marmol?"
The voice astonished him. He was always eager not to waste the time of someone summoning him from a waiting room. He hoped to his feet.
"That's me," he tried to say casually. Suddenly he wanted to impress everyone in the room. Not to seem like a nerd dufus. Like trying to clean the wet from water, he thought.
This was the kind of negative self-talk that some of his favorite library audiobooks warned him about.
