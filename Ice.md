## Ice
"Do you wear contacks?"

"No never," Arvin said. "I used to but then once a doctor told it was killing my retinal cells."

"That sounds unligely," the doctor said. "More ligely corneal abbrations." She over-articulated *corneal abbrations* and Arvin squirmed.

"Goddammit yuck," Arvin said. Excuse me.

"In general, do you have any trouble with your ice?" Her accent was thick and beautiful and unplaceable. She was brown in a way that mostly ruled out Eastern Europe but left most of the rest of the wide world as possibilities.

"You know I've never had a lady optometrist. Sorry: woman. Sorry: ophthalmologist. Woman ophthalmologist."

She just smiled. She was pretty enough without the accent but it pushed her right up to a 9 in Arvin's book. Arvin tried not to keep a "book" like this, he tried to be a decent and enlightened man who said "woman" and not "lady." But the road to hell is paved with good intentions and so on. He was human after all.

"Your ice. Everything ok?"

My ice. He couldn't place it. Eyes.

"Oh, fine. I mean they feel fine. I guess it's your job to tell me if they are fine."

She smiled again. She was so patient with him. He was more blabbery than usual. It was so rare he spoke to anyone much anymore he realized suddenly.

"Las take a look."
