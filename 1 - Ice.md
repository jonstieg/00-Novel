## 1 - Ice
"Do you wear contacks?"

"No never," Arvin said. "I used to but then once a doctor told it was killing my retinal cells."

"That sounds unligely," the doctor said. "More ligely corneal abbrations." She over-articulated *corneal abbrations* and Arvin squirmed.

"Goddammit yuck," Arvin said. "Excuse me."

"In general, do you have any trouble with your ice?" Her accent was thick and beautiful and unplaceable. She was brown in a way that mostly ruled out Eastern Europe but left most of the rest of the wide world as possibilities.

"You know I've never had a lady optometrist. Sorry: woman. Sorry: ophthalmologist. Woman ophthalmologist."

She just smiled. She was pretty enough without the accent but that pushed her right up to a 9 in Arvin's book. Arvin tried not to keep a "book" like this, he tried to be a decent and enlightened man who said "woman" and not "lady." But the road to hell is paved with good intentions and so on. He was human after all.

"Your ice. Everything ok?"

My ice. He couldn't place it.

Eyes. Duh, eyes.

"Oh, fine. I mean they feel fine. I guess it's your job to tell me if they are fine."

She smiled again. She was so patient with him. He was more blabbery than usual. It was so rare he spoke to anyone much anymore he realized suddenly.

"Las take a look."

She shut off the lights in the room and then sat cool-teach style, back of chair in front of her, on a little rolly stool-chair. She rolled over to him. The dark lights, the approach, the smell of her perfume, then the proximity all made him instantly horny. He was glad to have a little bag to put over his penis. He was glad not to have accepted the offer to put his bag down somewhere else. It was a small enough bag to keep in his lap, thanks. I might forget it if I hang it, thanks. Now it was an excellent, adhoc, came-by-it-honestly boner shield. This made him feel once again like a bad feminist enlightened man. To get a boner from hot doctor. Even to see her hotness. A feminist man's boner should be neither seen nor heard. Sex was always an act of power. Everything is about sex, what was it? Everything is about sex except sex, which is about power. This eye exam was suddenly all about sex for Arvin and his manly, horny hormones made him wonder if maybe just maybe there was a way. A way to have sex with this hot eye doctor. Ophthamologist. The impressive kind. A real *doctor* doctor, not some eye enthusiast with a certificate.

"How does it look?"

"Good." He had expected her to say "goot." He couldn't say a thing for certain about her accent, its origins, or what rules it played by.
